# AVL Tree Visualizer

## Overview
**AVL Tree Visualizer** is an interactive project that helps users **understand the working of AVL trees** through **dynamic visualization**.  
Users can **insert**, **delete**, and **search** nodes, and observe how the tree **self-balances** after every operation. This project is ideal for students and developers learning about **self-balancing binary search trees**.
